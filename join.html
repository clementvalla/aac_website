            <h3>FAQ</h3>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <p><strong>I don't know how to code. Can I still join?</strong></p>
                <p>Yes. We teach from first principles. No prior experience required.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <p><strong>The department is new—is that a problem?</strong></p>
                <p>No, it's an opportunity. You get to shape what it becomes. That's part of the education: being entrepreneurial, defining the future, building something together.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <p><strong>What kind of jobs can I get?</strong></p>
                <p>We prepare our students for: art practice (galleries, residencies), design work (UX, interaction design, creative technology), tech companies (Google, Adobe, startups), video games, or hybrid practices that combine all of these. Computational skills open multiple pathways.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <p><strong>What's the difference between Art & Computation and a CS program?</strong></p>
                <p>We're not training programmers. We're teaching you to work with computation as a creative medium. Technical skills are always threaded with cultural critique. You learn to build your own tools, question technology's impact, and use computation to make art and design that matters.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <p><strong>How much student work is there to look at?</strong></p>
                <p>We're new—the gallery is growing. But that means your work will help define what Art & Computation looks like. Ground floor opportunity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <p><strong>What equipment/software do I need?</strong></p>
                <p>We'll provide guidance. Most work can be done with a personal laptop and free/open-source software. As the department grows, we're building out facilities and equipment access.</p>
