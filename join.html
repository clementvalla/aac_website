            <h3>FAQ</h3>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <p><strong>I don't know how to code. Can I still join?</strong></p>
                <p>Yes. We teach from first principles. No prior experience required.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <p><strong>The department is new—is that a problem?</strong></p>
                <p>No, it's an opportunity. You get to shape what it becomes. That's part of the education: being entrepreneurial, defining the future, building something together.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <p><strong>What kind of jobs can I get?</strong></p>
                <p>We prepare our students for: art practice (galleries, residencies), design work (UX, interaction design, creative technology), tech companies (Google, Adobe, startups), video games, or hybrid practices that combine all of these. Computational skills open multiple pathways.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <p><strong>What's the difference between Art & Computation and a CS program?</strong></p>
                <p>We're not training programmers. We're teaching you to work with computation as a creative medium. Technical skills are always threaded with cultural critique. You learn to build your own tools, question technology's impact, and use computation to make art and design that matters.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <p><strong>How much student work is there to look at?</strong></p>
                <p>We're new—the gallery is growing. But that means your work will help define what Art & Computation looks like. Ground floor opportunity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <p><strong>What kind of computer do I need?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Your computer is probably fine.</strong> We can offer specific guidance when you get here. Most coursework can be done on a range of machines, and we support both Mac and PC.</p>
                
                <p>If you absolutely need to buy a new laptop, more powerful machines will allow you to run Unity, 3D modeling software, and video editing more smoothly. Here are general minimum requirements:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Minimum Specs (Mac or PC):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel i5/AMD Ryzen 5 (or Apple M1/M2) or better</li>
                    <li><strong>RAM:</strong> 8GB minimum, 16GB recommended</li>
                    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> 256GB minimum, 512GB recommended (SSD preferred)</li>
                    <li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Integrated graphics OK for most work; dedicated GPU helpful for Unity, 3D, video editing</li>
                    <li><strong>Screen:</strong> 13" or larger</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Recommended for 3D/Unity/Video:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB or more</li>
                    <li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Dedicated GPU (NVIDIA GTX/RTX series, AMD Radeon, or Apple M1 Pro/Max/Ultra)</li>
                    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> 512GB or larger SSD</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Software:</strong> Most of what we use is free and open-source (Processing, p5.js, VS Code, Blender, etc.). For Adobe Creative Suite and other paid tools, RISD provides student access.</p>
