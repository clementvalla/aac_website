11,CTC 2104-01,EXPERIMENTAL UNREAL,"This studio course reimagines game engine software as a critical tool for contemporary art and design practice. Moving beyond traditional gaming applications, we will use Epic Games Unreal Engine to invent unconventional approaches to digital art-making including: emergent design, speculative world building, as well as AI and physics-based processes (Note: traditional gameplay systems, player controller mechanics, and character animation will not be covered in the course).

The course emphasizes conceptual development alongside technical experimentation. Students will focus on the fundamentals of Blueprints visual scripting, the Niagara particle system, and AI Behavior Trees. In addition, we will discuss historical, experimental film, animation, music, architecture and process-based art movements such as Situationism, Gutai, and Neoconcretismo. Students from every fine art and design department are encouraged to join. Students will learn to bring their current art and design work into Unreal as 2D, 3D and motion assets. The semester culminates in self-directed projects that align with individual creative practices.

13,CTC 2105-01,STOP MAKING SENSE,"What does it mean to create art and design in a moment when technological systems are rapidly reshaping culture and society? Transformative systems such as artificial intelligence are reconfiguring how information is produced, circulated, and consumed, sometimes creating destabilizing forces such as deepfakes that threaten our shared realities while also offering novel materials for experimentation. In parallel, approaches such as speculative design and critical making allow artists and designers to probe these systems, imagine alternative technological futures, and test possibilities that extend beyond existing paradigms. How artists respond to this cultural inflection point will be decisive in shaping our technological future.

This course will unfold in two parts each week: a seminar-style discussion followed by a conversation with a visiting artist, designer, or technologist. In the first session, students will engage with readings and case studies related to the upcoming guest, situating their work in broader cultural, technological, and historical contexts. In the second session, students will meet the guest lecturer, who will provide a unique perspective on how artists and designers are actively producing work that both critiques current conditions and proposes new directions for rethinking the relationship between culture and technology. Our cultural reality is increasingly constructed through the technological interfaces we inhabit, so how will the artists of today and the students of this course choose to shape it?

14,CTC 2106-01,"BLUEWORLD, GREENWORLD, BROWNWORLD","This studio elective focuses on creating digital image-based artworks on the themes of nature and technology. How can nature be represented in art and design work? To what ends? And can digital art and design about nature impact the ways we understand and interact with our natural world, or affect our understanding of climate change? Students will be introduced to several tools, softwares, and code-based tools related to image-capture or digital image-making, and create short projects, focusing on landscape, nature, or weather, that utilize each. Students will then develop a final project which allows them to focus more deeply on these tools — or a related tool of their choice — more deeply. This studio work will be complemented by image lectures, readings, and class discussions to provide context and inspiration.

15,CTC 2107-01,COLLECTOR COLLECTING COLLECTIONS: CABINETS OF CURIOSITY,"This is a course about artists as collectors, collecting strange, wonderful stuff, and turning it into art. Each week you’ll experiment with gathering and organizing material from the world, recording sounds, photographing textures, scanning found objects, and then remix them into your own creative work. Along the way, you’ll get opportunities with hands-on with tools like audio recording, scanners, cameras, various printers, 3D and fabric printing, digital embroidery, and creative software such as Photoshop, Premiere, and 3D software. You’ll experiment with different ways to capture and organize your material. We’ll look at artists who treat archives as art, explore how collections shape culture, and invent new workflows that spark ideas. By the end, you’ll have your own evolving toolkit, an “asset library”, a cabinet of curiosity, to fuel any kind of work: video, sound, games, installation, design, painting, sculpture, collaborations, experiments, whatever you dream up.

16,CTC 2108-101,EVOLVING PICTURES,"In this course, students will learn how to create living image files in the Unity game engine. We will render images that play, shift, loop, and slowly evolve on screen. Students will begin by creating static images in the medium of their choice. We will then explore how the image can be separated into pieces and reformatted into digital objects. Using object-oriented programming, students will create algorithmic behaviors that allow the different pieces of their images to move in real-time, like a generative gif or an ever-changing landscape.

The first half of the course will focus on rule-based yet unpredictable systems, allowing our images to loop but never exactly repeat. In the second half, we will turn to autonomous processes that evolve over time, seeking a balance between order and variation without descending into chaotic noise. We will cover strategies including randomness, procedural duplication, particle flows, physics simulations, and agent-based systems. These explorations will be grounded in the history of image-making and motion pictures, drawing on Lev Manovich’s The Language of New Media to consider how images are no longer static artifacts, but programmable entities.

17,CTC 2257-01,DRAWING WITH COMPUTERS,"Exploring the question, ""What if my computer made my drawings for me?"" this course investigates the use of computational methods for creating drawings. Drawing inspiration from the likes of Mark Wilson, Vera Molnar, and Harold Cohen’s work with AARON, a life-long software that crafts significant art pieces, we will explore the historical and practical aspects of coding as a creative tool. Students will research the origins of computational making, learn basic scripting for artistic aims, understand generative drawings' material outputs, and participate in hands-on projects to foster innovation and exploration in computer-assisted drawing.
