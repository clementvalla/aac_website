SLIDE 1: TITLE

Partnership Proposal for Anthropic

Art & Computation
A new BFA at the Rhode Island School of Design

SLIDE 2: WHAT IS ART & COMPUTATION
-----------------------------------
Computation is the dominant medium of the 21st century. Art & Computation teaches students to work with it the way RISD has always worked with materials — across disciplines, hands-on, critically. Students build their own tools and creative pipelines to make art, tell stories, and shape how technology gets made.

ART SCHOOL DNA
147 years of materiality, experimentation, and critique — now applied to computation.

COMPUTATION AS MATERIAL
Code, algorithms, and systems as creative medium — like paint, clay, or film.

TOOLBUILDERS, NOT USERS
Students shape technology rather than consume it. Makers of systems, not just operators.

CRITICAL MAKING
Technical skill woven with ethics, culture, and critique from day one.


SLIDE 3: WHAT STUDENTS MAKE
----------------------------
Not just slideshows and concepts. Actual work. Prototypes, systems, tools, artworks. Websites, games, robots, data visualizations, 3D worlds, AI creative pipelines, custom digital tools.

SLIDE 4: A FLEXIBLE, EVOLVING MODEL
------------------------------------
Art & Computation introduces a new curricular model for RISD — open pathways that cross disciplines, emphasize electives, and are designed to adapt as technology evolves.

CROSS-INSTITUTIONAL REACH
Electives are open to all RISD students, expanding computational opportunities across the institution. A concentration in computation helps foster interdisciplinary work for students in other majors.

DESIGNED TO GROW
Multiple curricular pathways allow students and faculty to shape the department's direction. Clusters of interest can develop into full programs over time. New majors could emerge from faculty and student research — this is not a fixed department, but a RISD-specific, adaptive approach to computation.


SLIDE 5: WHAT PARTNERS GET
---------------------------
Talent pipeline — Access to graduates who think critically about AI and can push its creative boundaries. Not just users. Toolbuilders and questioners.

Creative stress-testing — Art students use tools in ways engineers never anticipate. They surface capabilities and blind spots that traditional testing misses.

Values alignment — "Safe and beneficial" AI needs people trained to question technology, not just deploy it. Art & Computation produces exactly those people.

Cultural legitimacy — Supporting the leading art school's computation program signals that AI is a creative medium worthy of deep artistic engagement.

Insight — What happens when trained artists work seriously with frontier AI? That's an interesting question for everyone.
